To create a preview image for your GitHub repository:

1. Take a screenshot of the running application
2. Save the screenshot as preview.png in the root directory
3. This image will be displayed in your README.md

Alternatively, you can:
- Use the browser's screenshot function
- Use a screen recording tool to capture a GIF of the interactive features
- Create a collage showing multiple aspects of the application
